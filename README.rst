Google Assistant Python Sample
==============================

This repository contains a Python sample for the Google Assistant API.

See `Getting Started with the Raspberry Pi 3 <https://developers.google.com/assistant/>`_ for
instructions on how to run the sample on supported hardware.

Prerequisites
-------------

- `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ (3.x prefered)
- `Google API Console Project <https://console.developers.google.com>`_ w/ Google Assistant API `enabled <https://console.developers.google.com/apis>`_.
- `OAuth client ID credentials <https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials>`_ with application type ``Other``.
- Use a new virtualenv (recommended)::

        # python3 (recommended)
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-venv
        python3 -m venv env
        env/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
        source env/bin/activate

        # python2
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install python-dev python-virtualenv
        virtualenv env --no-site-packages
        env/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
        source env/bin/activate

Setup
-----

- Install the sample dependencies::

        sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev

- Install the latest Google Assistant SDK and samples package from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_::

        python -m pip install --upgrade google-assistant-sdk[samples]

  - Or if working from this repository's sources, run::

          python -m pip install --upgrade -e ".[samples]"

- Authorize access to the Google Assistant API::

        python -m googlesamples.assistant.auth_helpers --client-secrets client_secret_XXXX.json
        Please go to this URL: ...
        Enter the authorization code:

-  Verify audio setup::

        # Record a 5 sec sample and play it back
        python -m googlesamples.assistant.audio_helpers

Run the Sample
--------------

- Record a voice query and the program should play back the Google Assistant's answer::

        python -m googlesamples.assistant

-  Record and send pre-recorded audio to the Assistant::

        python -m googlesamples.assistant -i in.wav

- Save Assistant response to a file::

        python -m googlesamples.assistant -o out.wav

Troubleshooting
---------------

- Verify ALSA setup::

        # Play a test sound
        speaker-test -t wav

        # Record and play back some audio using ALSA command-line tools
        arecord --format=S16_LE --duration=5 --rate=16k --file-type=raw out.raw
        aplay --format=S16_LE --rate=16k --file-type=raw out.raw

- Run the sample with verbose logging enabled::

        python -m googlesamples.assistant --verbose

- If Assistant audio is choppy, try adjusting the sound device's block size::

        # If using a USB speaker or dedicated soundcard, set block size to "0" 
        # to automatically adjust the buffer size
        python -m googlesamples.assistant.audio_helpers --audio-block-size=0

        # If using the line-out 3.5mm audio jack on the device, set block size
        # to a value larger than the `ConverseResponse` audio payload size
        python -m googlesamples.assistant.audio_helpers --audio-block-size=3200

        # Run the Assistant sample using the best block size value found above
        python -m googlesamples.assistant --audio-block-size=value

- If Assistant audio is truncated, try adjusting the sound device's flush size:: 

        # Set flush size to a value larger than the audio block size
        python -m googlesamples.assistant --audio-block-size=3200 --audio-flush-size=6400
